# Full-Stack-Web-app
A simple full stack web app using node as backend and angular as front end

In this application user can search for doctors based on search criteria filled by the user. If no input is mentioned then all details would be

access would be implemented so that data is fetched from the database rather than hard code values.

Web app has been deployed on Heroku and can be access by the following url:
